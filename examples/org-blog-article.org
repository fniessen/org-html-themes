Never apologize for what you feel. It's like being sorry for being real.

* Introduction
Writing clean code is an essential skill for any programmer. Clean
code is not just about making the code work; it is about writing code
that is readable, maintainable, and efficient.

* Principles of Clean Code

** Meaningful Names
Using meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes makes the
code more readable and self-explanatory[fn:1]. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
int userCount = 10; // Good
int x = 10;        // Bad
#+END_SRC

** Small Functions
Functions should be small and do only one thing. A function with
multiple responsibilities is harder to understand and maintain.

** Consistent Formatting
Maintaining a consistent formatting style across the codebase improves
readability and reduces cognitive load[fn:2].

* Example Code
Hereâ€™s an example of a cleanly written C++ function:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
#include <iostream>

void printUserCount(int count) {
    std::cout << "Total users: " << count << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int userCount = 10;
    printUserCount(userCount);
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

* Conclusion
By following the principles of clean code, we can create software that
is easier to understand and maintain. This leads to better
collaboration and long-term project success.

* Footnotes
[fn:1] Always name variables descriptively to avoid confusion later.
[fn:2] Functions should not exceed 20 lines for better readability.
