This is an Org mode document.

*Org mode* is a easy-to-write /plain text/ formatting syntax for authoring LaTeX
documents, creating Web pages and much more!

* Basics

** Biggest heading

New chapter.

*** Bigger heading

New section.

**** Big heading

New sub-section.

**** Text breaks

A single newline has no effect.
This line is part of the same paragraph.

But an empty line

demarcates paragraphs.

By entering two consecutive backslashes,
you can force to break lines \\
without starting a new paragraph.

For an horizontal line, insert at least 5 dashes: this is some text above an
horizontal rule
-----
and some text below it.

**** Numbered headings

You can create numbered headings up to a certain level by setting an option:

#+begin_src org
,#+OPTIONS: H:4
#+end_src

*** Text width

# Premiere Elements, page 111
#
# Vous pouvez créer ces objets en cliquant sur le bouton Nouvel| élément de le
# fenêtre Média. (Le Chapitre 14 explique comment créer| des titres ; le
# Chapitre 15 montre l'utilisation des barres et ton, de la| vidéo noir et de
# l'amorce SMPTE.)
#
# The principles of beautiful Web design, page 6
#
# In a figurative sense, the concept of visual balance is similar to that of
# physical balance| illustrated by a seesaw. Just as physical objects have
# weight, so do the elements of a layout.| If the elements on either side of a
# layout are of equal weight, they balance one another.| There are two main forms
# of visual balance: symmetrical and asymmetrical.

One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed
and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.

** Lists

Org markup allows you to create bulleted or numbered lists. It allows any
combination of the two list types.

*** Unordered lists

Itemized lists are marked with bullets. They are convenient to:

- organize data, and
- make the document
  + prettier, and
  + easier to read.

Create them with a minus or a plus sign.

*** Ordered lists

Enumerated lists are marked with numbers or letters:

1. First element
   1) First sub-item
   2) Last sub-item
2. Second element

You can have ordered lists with jumping numbers:

1. [@1] First
2. [@2] Second
5. [@5] Jump to 5th

*** Definition lists

- Definition list ::
     List containing definitions.

- Term to define ::
     Explication of the term.

*** Checkboxes
- [ ] First item not checked
- [-] Second item half done
  - [ ] Another first
  - [ ] Another second
- [X] Third item checked

** Miscellaneous effects

*** Include Org files

You can include another Org file and skip its title by using the ~:lines~ argument
to ~#+INCLUDE~:

#+begin_src org
,#+INCLUDE: chapter1.org :lines "2-"
#+end_src

#+begin_note
File inclusion, through INCLUDE keywords, is an *export-only feature*.
#+end_note

*** Inline HTML

You can include raw HTML in your Org documents and it will get kept as HTML
when it's exported. XXX

#+HTML_BEGIN: <pre style="color:red">
Text can be preformatted (in a fixed-width font).
#+HTML_END: </pre>

It is especially useful for more advanced stuff like images or tables where you
need more control of the HTML options than Org mode actually gives you.

Similarly, you can incorporate JS or do anything else you can do in a Web page
(such as importing a CSS file).

You can create named classes (to get style control from your CSS) with:

#+begin_example
,#+begin_info
,*Info example* \\
Did you know...
,#+end_info
#+end_example

You can also add interactive elements to the HTML such as interactive R plots.

Finally, you can include an HTML file verbatim (during export) with:

#+begin_src org
,#+INCLUDE: file.html html
#+end_src

Don't edit the exported HTML file!

*** Inline LaTeX

You can also use raw LaTeX. XXX

#+LaTeX_BEGIN: \begin{verbatim}
Text can be preformatted (in a fixed-width font).
#+LaTeX_END: \end{verbatim}

*** Centered text

#+begin_center
This text is centered!
#+end_center

** Code blocks

*** COMMENT Syntax highlighting

The source code blocks support syntax highlighting:

#+begin_src cpp :eval no
/*
 * Application that displays a "Hello" message to the standard output.
 */
int main(int arc, char **argv)
{
  printf("Hello, %s!\n", (argc>1) ? argv[1] : "World");
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

The following language strings are currently recognized:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results drawer :exports results
(concat (mapconcat (lambda (widget)
                     (widget-get widget :tag))
                   (cl-remove-if-not (lambda (it)
                                       (and (consp it)
                                            (eq (car it) 'const)))
                                     (cdr
                                      (widget-get
                                       (get
                                        'org-babel-load-languages 'custom-type)
                                       :key-type)))
                   ", ")
        ".")
#+end_src

#+results:
:RESULTS:
Awk, C, R, Asymptote, Calc, Clojure, CSS, Ditaa, Dot, Emacs Lisp, Fortran, Gnuplot, Haskell, IO, J, Java, Javascript, LaTeX, Ledger, Lilypond, Lisp, Makefile, Maxima, Matlab, Mscgen, Ocaml, Octave, Org, Perl, Pico Lisp, PlantUML, Python, Ruby, Sass, Scala, Scheme, Screen, Shell Script, Shen, Sql, Sqlite, ebnf2ps.
:END:

Code block with long lines:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
testing testing testing testing testing testing testing testing testing testing
0        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8         9
123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456
#+end_src

For PDF (LaTeX), one  solution is to surround the code  block such as:

#+latex: \scriptsize
#+begin_src R
print("This block is in scriptsize")
#+end_src
#+latex: \normalize

*** Line numbers

Both in ~example~ and in ~src~ snippets, you can add a ~-n~ switch to the end of the
~begin~ line, to get the lines of the example numbered.

#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp -n
(defun org-xor (a b)
  "Exclusive or."
#+end_src

If you use a ~+n~ switch, the numbering from the previous numbered snippet will
be continued in the current one:

#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp +n
  (if a (not b) b))
#+end_src

In literal examples, Org will interpret strings like ~(ref:name)~ as labels, and
use them as targets for special hyperlinks like ~[[(name)]]~ (i.e., the reference
name enclosed in single parenthesis).  In HTML, hovering the mouse over such
a link will remote-highlight the corresponding code line, which is kind of
cool.

You can also add a ~-r~ switch which removes the labels from the source code.
With the ~-n~ switch, links to these references will be labeled by the line
numbers from the code listing, otherwise links will use the labels with no
parentheses.  Here is an example:

#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp -n -r
(save-excursion                  ; (ref:sc)
  (goto-char (point-min)))       ; (ref:jump)
#+end_src

In line [[(sc)]], we remember the current position.  [[(jump)][Line (jump)]] jumps to
~point-min~.

*** Output

The output from the *execution* of programs, scripts or commands can be inserted
in the document itself, allowing you to work in the /reproducible research/
mindset.

**** Text

A one-liner result:

#+begin_src sh :exports both :results verbatim
date +"%Y-%m-%d"
#+end_src

#+results:
: 2014-03-15

# A multiple-line result:
#
# #+name: list-of-styles
# #+begin_src sh :exports both :results verbatim
# # output all styles, but the default one (if any)
# ls styles | grep -v "default"
# #+end_src
#
# #+results: list-of-styles
# #+begin_example
# bigblow
# leuven
# maunakea
# #+end_example

**** Graphics

Data to be charted:

#+name: data
| Month | Degrees |
|-------+---------|
|     1 |     3.8 |
|     2 |     4.1 |
|     3 |     6.3 |
|     4 |     9.0 |
|     5 |    11.9 |
|     6 |    15.1 |
|     7 |    17.1 |
|     8 |    17.4 |
|     9 |    15.7 |
|    10 |    11.8 |
|    11 |     7.7 |
|    12 |     4.8 |

Code:

#+name: R-plot
#+begin_src R :var data=data :results graphics :file ../../images/Rplot.png :exports both
plot(data, type="b", bty="l", col=c("#ABD249"), las=1, lwd=4)
grid(nx=NULL, ny=NULL, col=c("#E8E8E8"), lwd=1)
legend("bottom", legend=c("Degrees"), col=c("#ABD249"), pch=c(19))
#+end_src

The resulting chart:

#+results: R-plot
[[file:../../images/Rplot.png]]

**** R code block

#+begin_src R
library(ggplot2)
summary(cars)
#+end_src

Plot:

#+begin_src R
library(ggplot2)
qplot(speed, dist, data = cars) + geom_smooth()
#+end_src

** Inline code

You can also evaluate code inline as follows: 1 + 1 is src_R{1 + 1}.

** Notes at the footer

It is possible to define named footnotes[fn:myfootnote], or ones with
automatic anchors[fn:2].

** Formatting text

*** Text effects

/Emphasize/ (italics), *strongly* (bold), and */very strongly/* (bold italics).

Markup elements could be nested: this is /italic text which contains
_underlined text_ within it/, whereas _this is normal underlined text_.

Markup can span across multiple lines, by default *no more than 2*:

*This
is not
bold*

Other elements to use sparingly are:
- monospaced typewriter font for ~inline code~
- monospaced typewriter font for =verbatim text=
- +deleted+ text (vs. _inserted_ text)
- text with^{superscript} (for example: ~m/s^{2}~ gives m/s^{2})
- text with_{subscript} (for example: ~H_{2}O~ gives H_{2}O)

*** Quotations

Use the ~quote~ block to typeset quoted text.

#+begin_quote
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
computer to do.

The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose
main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with
thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what
each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible
because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human
understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce
each other.

--- Donald Knuth
#+end_quote

A short one:

#+begin_quote
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
#+end_quote

In a ~verse~ environment, there is an implicit line break at the end of each
line, and indentation and vertical space are preserved:

#+begin_verse
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
#+end_verse

Typically used for quoting passages of an email message:

#+begin_verse
>> This is an email message with "nested" quoting. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
>> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
>> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
>
> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem
> consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

Itemized or unordered lists (~ul~):
- This is the first list item.
- This is the second list item.

Enumerated or ordered Lists (~ol~):
1. This is the first list item.
2. This is the second list item.

Maybe an equation here?

See http://www.google.com/ for more information...
#+end_verse

*** Spaces

Using non-breaking spaces.

Insert the Unicode character ~00A0~ to add a non-breaking space. FIXME
Or add/use an Org entity?

** Mathematical formulae

You can embed LaTeX math formatting in Org mode files using the following
syntax:

- For *inline math* expressions, use ~\(...\)~: \(x^2\) or \(1 < 2\).

  It's /not/ advised to use the constructs ~$...$~ (both for Org and MathJax).

- Centered display equation (the /Euler theorem/):

  \[
  \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = {{\sqrt{\pi}} \over {2}}
  \]

  The use of ~\[...\]~ is for mathematical expressions which you want to make
  *stand out, on their own lines*.

  LaTeX allows to inline such ~\[...\]~ constructs (/quadratic formula/):
  \[ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a} \]

  *Double dollar signs (~$$~) should not be used*.

- The /sinus theorem/ can then be written as the equation:

  \begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:sinalpha}
  \frac{\sin\alpha}{a}=\frac{\sin\beta}{b}
  \end{equation}

- See Equation [[the-first]],

  #+name: the-first
  \begin{equation}
  n_{i+1} = \frac{n_{i} (d-i) (e-1)}{(i+1)}
  \end{equation}

  Only captioned equations are numbered

- Other alternative: use \begin{equation*} or \begin{displaymath} (= the verbose
  form of the ~\[...\]~ construct). M-q does not fill those.

Differently from $...$ and \(...\), an equation environment produces a *numbered*
equation to which you can add a label and reference the equation by (label)
name in other parts of the text. This is not possibly with unnumbered math
environments ($$, ...).

** Special characters

Some of the widely used special characters (converted from text characters to
their typographically correct entitites):

*** Accents

\Agrave \Aacute

*** Punctuation

Dash: \ndash \mdash

Marks: \iexcl \iquest

Quotations: \laquo \raquo

Miscellaneous: \para \ordf

*** Commercial symbols

Property marks: \copy \reg

Currency: \cent \EUR \yen \pound

*** Greek characters

The Greek letters \alpha, \beta, and \gamma are used to denote angles.

*** Math characters

Science: \pm \div

Arrows: \to \rarr \larr \harr \rArr \lArr \hArr

Function names: \arccos \cos

Signs and symbols: \bull \star

*** Misc

# Smilies: \smiley \sad

Suits: \clubs \spades

** Comments

It's possible to add comments in the document.

# This Org comment here won't be displayed.

** Tables

You can create tables with an optional header row (by using an horizontal line
of dashes to separate it from the rest of the table).

#+CAPTION: An example of table
| Header 1    | Header 2      | Header 3 |
|-------------+---------------+----------|
| Top left    | Top middle    |          |
|             |               | Right    |
| Bottom left | Bottom middle |          |

Columns are automatically aligned:

- Number-rich columns to the right, and
- String-rich columns to the left.

If you want to override the automatic alignment, use ~<r>~, ~<c>~ or ~<l>~.

#+CAPTION: Table with alignment
|          <r> |     <c>      | <l>          |
|            1 |      2       | 3            |
|        right |    center    | left         |
| xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx |

Placement:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
| a | b |
| 1 | 2 |

XXX
Different from the following:

| a | b |
| 1 | 2 |

*** Align tables on the page

Here is a table on the left side:

#+LATEX: \noindent
#+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
| a | b | c |
|---+---+---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
#+LATEX: \hfill

The noindent just gets rid of the indentation of the first line of a paragraph
which in this case is the table. The hfill adds infinite stretch after the
table, so it pushes the table to the left.

Here is a centered table:

| a | b | c |
|---+---+---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |

And here's a table on the right side:

#+LATEX: \hfill
#+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
| a | b | c |
|---+---+---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |

Here the hfill adds infinite stretch before the table, so it pushes the table
to the right.

** Images, video and audio

*** Images

You can insert *image* files of different *formats* to a page:

|      | HTML                         | PDF |
|------+------------------------------+-----|
| gif  | yes                          |     |
| jpeg | yes                          |     |
| png  | yes                          |     |
| bmp  | (depends on browser support) |     |

In-line picture:

#+CAPTION: Org mode logo
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.25\linewidth
[[file:../../images/org-mode-unicorn.png]]

Direct link to just the [[file:org-mode-unicorn.png][Unicorn picture file]].

XXX Available HTML image tags include:

- align
- border
- bordercolor
- hspace
- vspace
- width
- height
- title
- alt

Place images side by side: XXX

*** Video

Videos can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

[[http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg][http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE]]

*** Sounds

** Special text boxes

Simple box ("inline task"): XXX

# *************** TODO Do this task
# Description of inline task.
# *************** END
#
# or:
#
# *************** WAIT [#B] Do also this other task                        :phone:
# *************** END

*** Example

You can have ~example~ blocks.

Find entries with an *exact phrase* -- To do this, put the phrase in quotes:

: "hd ready"

You can create several other boxes (~info~, ~tip~, ~note~ or ~warning~) which all have
a different default image.

*** Info

An info box is displayed as follows:

#+begin_info
*Info example* \\
Did you know...
#+end_info

*** Tip

A tip box is displayed as follows:

#+begin_tip
*Tip example* \\
Try doing it this way...
#+end_tip

*** Note

A note box is displayed as follows:

#+begin_note
*Note example* \\
This is a useful note...
#+end_note

*** Warning

A warning box is displayed as follows:

#+begin_warning
*Warning example* \\
Be careful!  Check that you have...
#+end_warning

** Links
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: links
   :END:

*** Anchors
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       0d2b0cb2-116c-4a61-a076-4c641faf4346
   :END:

Links generally point to an headline.

They can also point to a link anchor <<name-of-anchor-here>> in the current
document or in another document.

*** Hyperlinks

This document is available in [[file:example.txt][plain text]], [[file:example.html][HTML]] and [[file:example.pdf][PDF]].

The links are delimited by ~[square brackets]~.

**** Internal links

See:
- chapter [[#links][Links]]
- section [[id:0d2b0cb2-116c-4a61-a076-4c641faf4346][Anchors]]
- [[name-of-anchor-here][target in the document]]

* Org miscellaneous

** Dates

Timestamps: [2014-01-16 Thu] and <2014-01-16 Thu>.

** DONE [#A] Buy GTD book                                               :online:
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "TODO"        ->  "DONE"       [2014-01-16 Thu 09:52]
   :END:

By default, ~DONE~ actions will be collapsed.

Note that I should probably implement that default behavior only for ~ARCHIVE~'d
items.

** TODO [#A] Read GTD book
   SCHEDULED: <2014-09-11 Thu>

By default, *all* (active) entries will be expanded at page load, so that their
contents is visible.

That can be changed by adding such a line (into your Org document):

#+begin_src org
,#+HTML_HEAD: <script> var HS_STARTUP_FOLDED = true; </script>
#+end_src

** TODO [#B] Apply GTD methodoloy
   DEADLINE: <2014-12-01 Mon>
   :PROPERTIES:
   :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS:    hsCollapsed
   :END:

This section will be collapsed when loading the page because the entry has the
value ~hsCollapsed~ for the property ~:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS:~.

Powerful, no?

** Some note                                                    :computer:write:

You can add tags to any entry, and hightlight all entries having some specific
tag by clicking on the buttons made accessible to you in the "Dashboard".

** Weekly review                                                      :computer:

Now, you can even make your weekly review in the HTML export... Press the ~r~ key
to start entering the "review mode" where all but one active entry are
collapsed, so that you can really focus on one item at a time!
