themes.

*Org-HTML Themes* is an innovative, open-source framework that delivers
a collection of stunning, cross-browser themes designed to transform your Org
documents. Use these themes to elevate your document's visual design, create

Follow [[https://mastodon.social/@fniessen][@fniessen on Mastodon]] for the latest updates on Org-HTML themes!

** Requirements

Org mode version 8 (or later) is required.

If such a version is not bundled with your Emacs, install one from ELPA.

*** What people are saying about Bigblow

"Very very nice, I enjoy it a lot." \\
-- /Ista Zahn/

"This is awesome.  I love it!" \\
-- /Rainer M Krug/

"This is awesome!!" \\
-- /Mehul Sanghvi/

"This very nice html theme. [...]  I cannot use another emacs-theme than your
[[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme][emacs-leuven-theme]], and it is going to be probably the same with your html
theme!" \\
-- /Joseph Vidal-Rosset/

"Thanks a lot for sharing [...] the wonderful Bigblow theme.  I create lot of
specification for other team members to use.  It has always been a trouble to
share and maintain such spec.  Now, I can create a much neater spec which is
available for the team's reference as a webpage." \\
-- /Shankar R./

"I like Bigblow the best.  I've exported most of my Org files using this theme
and published them within my company's intranet.  Thanks for sharing this
wonderful package!" \\
-- /Richard K./

** ReadTheOrg

ReadTheOrg is a clone of the official -- and great! -- [[https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme][Sphinx theme]] used in the
[[http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][Read The Docs]] site.  It gives a beautiful and professional style to all your Org
docs.

*Thanks to its creator(s)!*

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 640
[[file:docs/readtheorg.png]]

#+begin_note
While the original theme shines on mobile devices as well, ReadTheOrg does not
stay completely functional.

I don't have a lot of time to maintain this project due to other
responsibilities.  Help is welcome to work on that (and eventually improve the
default structure of the HTML export)!

*** What people are saying about ReadTheOrg

-- /Rob Stewart/

"It is fantastic, so beautiful.  I will switch several of my pages over to
this theme." \\
-- /Carsten D./

-- /Noah R./

-- /Kang T./

"Awesome theme.  Wonderful job.  You're doing a wonderful thing --- it will
enable people (at least those who use Emacs and Org mode) to put together
on-line reference works in a much-more usable fashion than is currently
available." \\
-- /D. C. Toedt/

"Extremely useful." \\
-- /Thomas S. Dye/

"This is amazing, I've been looking for something like this for a LONG time!
I will share." \\

* Demo

I've written a [[file:examples/org-mode-syntax-example.org][demo page]] for the themes that provides a maximal working support
of Org mode syntax.

Please see the [[https://github.com/fniessen/refcard-org-mode][Org mode refcard]] page for full examples of headings, code,
admonitions, footnotes, tables and other details.

* Using a theme

Using a theme from the [[id:79e0ed21-c3b0-4f00-bdab-29fbff9dcad4][theme gallery]] for your own Org documents is very easy:

1. You *add a* =#+SETUPFILE:= *directive* in the preamble of your document (to include
   the necessary CSS and JavaScript files).

   You can either use an URL of the following type for the "setup file" of your
   chosen theme:

   #+begin_src org :exports code
   ,#+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/org/theme-NAME.setup
   #+end_src

   (where ~NAME~ is either ~bigblow~ or ~readtheorg~)

   or, if you *cloned or downloaded* the Org-HTML themes project -- to get no
   dependency on an Internet connection --, use a (relative or absolute) path to
   the /local/ "setup file" and copy the =src= folder from the cloned folder
   into the same folder as the file you want to export:

   #+begin_src org :exports code
   ,#+SETUPFILE: PATH/TO/GIT/REPO/org/theme-NAME-local.setup
   #+end_src

2. Then, you *export* your Org mode file *to HTML* with =org-html-export-to-html= or
   with =C-c C-e h h=.

* Customizing a theme

You love those themes, but you still would like to override particular HTML
tags?  Some examples do follow...

Before doing that, though, if you think it really is an improvement that could
serve other persons as well, including me, you're invited to submit your
change...

** Change the background code blocks

Here's an example to insert into your Org documents:

#+begin_src org
# Change the background of source block.
,#+HTML_HEAD: <style>pre.src{background:#343131;color:white;} </style>
#+end_src

** Unset body width limit of ReadTheOrg

Solution provided by Malcolm Cook:

#+begin_src org
,#+HTML_HEAD: <style> #content{max-width:1800px;}</style>
,#+HTML_HEAD: <style> p{max-width:800px;}</style>
,#+HTML_HEAD: <style> li{max-width:800px;}</style
#+end_src
